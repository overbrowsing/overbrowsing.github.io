## Introduction

Overbrowsing is an applied research group dedicated to advancing our understanding of sustainable web design and development practises.


Overbrowsing occurs when herbivores graze excessively, exerting pressure on the environment, and this word, which has a common origin with internet browsing, corresponds with the initiative's core mission.


We are committed to shaping an innovative and mindful digital future, our approach is a blend of inquiry and action. The goal is to raise awareness, share crucial insights on the urgent need to reduce excess, and ignite tangible change. 


The project advocates for conscious strategies, resource optimisation, and ethical considerations. Fostering a harmonious coexistence between technology and the planet.
