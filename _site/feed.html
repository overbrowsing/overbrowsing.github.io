          <p>1 – Websites are places. They provide services, they serve and frame content. Watching a video on Nowness is different from watching a video on YouTube. Buying an onigiri from a 7-11 branch is different from buying a buttered pretzel from a Bavarian bakery. There may be a digital equivalent to the Zumthorian Atmosphere.

2 – Websites are inherently public. In similar ways, architecture is by nature a public discipline. Buildings and websites are built realities. They become part of the fabric of a world that is now both physical and virtual.

3 – Websites are inhabited. They become part of society through the interactions they enable. They are homes to communities, to thoughts and approaches. Many websites are privately owned and operated, but inhabited and used by the public. As buildings, website are where we spend our lives.

4 – Websites are constructed. Relevant websites may use new materials or existing materials to new effect. They may employ new ways of construction, or cite old ways of construction. Similarly, material and construction are defining characteristics of every architectural work.

5 – Websites are cultural artifacts. Like buildings, websites foster social discourses. They do so by establishing new ways of interaction or by initiating new aesthetic discourses.

6 – Websites are constructed. Websites may use new technologies or existing technology to new effect. They may employ new ways of construction, or cite old ways of construction. Similarly, material and construction are defining characteristics of architectural work.

7 – Websites age. As buildings, some get better with age. Some decay. Others get renovated or re-purposed.

8 – Websites exist within frameworks. They negotiate contrasting requirements. Similarly, architecture deals with zoning and building regulations. Smart integration or avoidance of such requirements is a source for good and efficient design in both cases.

9 – Websites are made by individuals, by collectives or by large-scale project groups, decisively influencing their aims, design quality and building process. Similar differences exist between private construction and large-scale urban projects. There is value in each scale.

10 – Websites are prototypical. Referencing Rem Koolhaas, websites are editions of one. As architectural projects, they remain experimental and non-serial by nature.

          <p>In the beginning was the Web, and the Web was good. Well, in this case, the beginning was the early 90s, and &quot;good&quot; meant a site had found its way onto the Yahoo! index page and the visitor counter was spinning at the bottom of the table-laden, animated GIF-infec-ted page.
But that&#39;s all you really needed in those days. As long as you were feeding your fellow webring subscribers with click-throughs, all of the webmasters were happy. And those webmasters? Yes, they were masters of their domain..literally! Websites were simple creatures, and the webmaster was their keeper, tending to the tangle of HTML and wondering if these new Cascading Style Sheets were something to be bothered with; most had already written off JavaScript as a passing fad.</p>

buying a DVD - counting everything from mine-mouth and forest to consumer? Does playing a video

answer involves more than knowing how much electricity one iPad, PC or smartphone uses. It requires

accounting for all the electricity used in the entire ICT ecosystem needed to make any of that possible.</p>

          <p>When we type a letter in to the address bar of a browser it&#39;s likely the browser pre-requests the website it thinks you&#39;re likely to load. If you don&#39;t continue typing what it thought you would, that request is wasted - somewhere on the other side of the world a server woke up from sleep, spun up it&#39;s hard drives and transmitted for thousands of miles what was requested, only for it to be refused. When we browse the internet, we often don&#39;t consider the extensive resources involved in transmission of invisible data.</p>

          <p>I love the idea that we can use gardening as a metaphor to better learn about online spaces. Gardens have an organized chaos. Gardens are communal. You have to have many hands supporting the work of maintaining a garden. Gardens are messy. You&#39;re going to have things die, rot, and tangled roots. Gardens embrace that messiness. The platforms that we currently have move away from messiness. There&#39;s a level of curation that becomes a flaw in the ability of people to actually connect to one another and to connect with knowledge. Digital gardens create this metaphor and opportunity to reimagine online spaces.</p>

          <p>&quot;You know what makes a garden?

Weeding.

Gardens aren&#39;t just about the thriving of the desired plants.  They&#39;re also about the non-thriving of the non-desired plants.

And weeding is hard work, and it&#39;s boring, and it&#39;s tedious, and it&#39;s unsexy.&quot;</p>

          <p>I’ve come to think of software applications as a form of digital architecture: some are places of concentration, others of collaboration, others clearly just for fun. Software’s emotional dimension is crucial: how it feels dictates how it’s used. (Architects hire environmental psychologists; tech companies hire user-experience researchers.) Microsoft Word is the quiet room at the university library; personal Gmail is a dirty kitchen, yesterday’s plates stacked next to the sink; Twitter is an overcrowded bar. Throughout the day, I’ll move from room to room, alternating between solitude and socializing, work and play.</p>
